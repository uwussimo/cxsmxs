Basically, after using Rust programming language within TypeScript ecosystem, I came up with an idea
to create a stack using Rust and TypeScript.

<div align="center">

<img width="200" src="/about/love.png" />
<img width="200" src="/about/typescript.png" />
</div>

After experimenting with many frameworks and tech stacks, I created the one and only stack which
works productive and most importantly, blazingly fast!!! This stack is the only stack that I use
personally myself. Therefore, I maintain it and make it comply with current tech trend.
